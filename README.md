# Reimagining_3DVG

Re_3DVG proposes a method for fragmented point cloud scenarios. Utilizing instance segmentation and transformer models, our approach offers a potent mechanism for establishing robust correspondences between text queries and object instances within the shared visible range.

## Download

The fragmented 3DVG dataset can be downloaded from:

## Installation

Our project has been tested on torch=1.13 cuda=11.7 python=3.7.5

## Train

You can use the following scripts for the train: T_V_en_base_with_F_4L_e4_BERT.py

## Inference

You can use the example scripts demo.py in the demo directory to perform RGB images, depth images, and text descriptions. 

## Comparison Experiment
